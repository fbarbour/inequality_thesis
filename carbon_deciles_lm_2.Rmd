This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
fp <- c("log_CF ~ gini_disp + gini_wealth + log_expend")
cntrl <- c("", 
           " + log_popDensity + urbanisation", 
           " + tech_index + active_pop", 
           " + log_popDensity + urbanisation + tech_index + active_pop")
frms <- paste0(fp, cntrl)


random_effects <- map(.x = frms, .f = function(x) {
    plm(
        formula = eval(x),
        index = c("Country.Code", "decile"), data = carbon_deciles_st, 
        effect = "individual", model = "random"
)})


pooling <- map(.x = frms, .f = function(x) {
    plm(
        formula = eval(x),
        index = c("Country.Code", "decile"), data = carbon_deciles_st, 
        effect = "individual", model = "pooling"
)})
```


### Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier (LM)
The Lagrange multiplier helps decide between random effects regression or a simple OLS regression. The null hypothesis is that variances across entities is zero, thus no significant difference across units (no panel effect). If p<0.05 a random model is preferred. 

```{r}
map(pooling, plmtest, type = "bp")
```


### Testing for cross-sectional dependnece
The cross-sectional dependence test check if the residuals are correlated across entities.p-values are >> 0.05 for all models, suggesting that there is cross-sectional dependence. Cross-sectional dependence can lead to bias in tests results (also called contemporaneous correlation)

```{r}
map(random_effects, pcdtest, test = c('lm'))
map(random_effects, pcdtest,test = c("cd"))
```
```{r}
map(pooling, pcdtest, test = c('lm'))
map(pooling, pcdtest,test = c("cd"))
```


```{r}
vcov <- map(random_effects, plm::vcovHC, method = "arellano", type = "HC2", cluster = "group") # Arellano
random_effects_HC <- map2(random_effects, vcov, coeftest)

vcov <- map(pooling, plm::vcovHC, method = "arellano", type = "HC2", cluster = "group") # Arellano
pooling_HC <- map2(pooling, vcov, coeftest)
```
